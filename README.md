# NI_DAQs

Welcome to the NI cDAQ repository! 

All functions currently available are found in cDAQ api.

Simple execution examples can be found in the execution_examples repository.

Instron DAQ execution (will) hold all Instron files for different modular set-ups.

Coming Soon:
	More Modularity for 4 channel resistance measurement
	Higher Speed Sampling (1.0e5 Hz is python's limit)

Any questions or requests, reach out to Brandon Kuhnert.
